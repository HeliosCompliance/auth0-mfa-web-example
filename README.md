# auth0-mfa-web-example

This project shows how an Auth0 user can list, add and delete his/her MFA devices using [MFA API](https://auth0.com/docs/multifactor-authentication/api) (which is just a part of [Authentication API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#multi-factor-authentication)) directly from a web page without any backend. Currently, it only supports adding SMS and OPT. Also, note that you can't delete "recovery-code" device using MFA API (use [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/#!/Guardian/delete_enrollments_by_id) for that or see my [another project](https://github.com/stszap/auth0-mfa-custom-login-form/settings)). It's based on [this](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-javascript-samples/tree/master/01-Login) code.

**Configuration steps:**

1. Enable "SMS" and "One-time Password" factors and enable "Always require Multi-factor Authentication" switch [docs](https://auth0.com/docs/multifactor-authentication#1-enable-the-factors-you-require) 
1. Create a new SPA [docs](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard/guides/applications/register-app-spa)
1. Go yo your SPA setting and add "http://localhost:3000" (don't add the slash at the back) to "Allowed Callback URLs", "Allowed Web Origins", "Allowed Logout URLs", "Allowed Origins (CORS)"
1. Go to "Advanced Settings" of the SPA and enable "MFA" grant type
1. Copy `config.json.example` file to `config.json` in the repo's dir and put your Auth0 domain and SPA client id in there
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run start` (make sure you port 3000 is free) and open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

**Usage tips:**

* After you log in your access token, user info and a list of MFA devices will be displayed.
* To delete a device just copy it's id from the list to the input field next to "Delete by id" in "Manage MFA devices" block and press "delete".
* To add a phone number enter it to the input next to "Add new SMS device" (use `+1234567890` format) and press "add". You should receive an SMS with a code (if your Auth0 account is configured correctly or you still have free quota), enter the code into the new input that under the phone number and press "verify".
* To add an OTP device just press "add" button next to "Add new OTP device" then a new block with QR code should appear. Scan the QR code or copy OTP secret to your Google Authenticator (or similar software), enter 6-digit code and press "verify".
* Note that access token is only valid for 10 minutes. After that, you will have to login again.
